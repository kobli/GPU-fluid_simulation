# Smoothed particle hydrodynamics

This is a term project on topic of fluid simulation using smoothed particle hydrodynamic. It is implemented on GPU using compute shaders, OpenGL is used for a simple visualization where the particles are represented by balls. The CPU implementation that was used to validate the GPU implementation is included as well.
